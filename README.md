# üïπÔ∏è Rambo Shooter

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Rambo Shooter** project! This project was developed as part of our first semester coursework by me and two other colleagues. It is a fun and engaging game where players take on the role of a sharpshooter navigating through various challenges.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

- **`main code/`**: Contains the source code files for the project with documentation.
- **`libraries/`**: Includes SFML-specific headers and configuration files
- **`Media/`**: Holds all necessary resources such as images, audio files, and other assets required for the game.
- **`Visual Studio Project/`**: Contains Visual Studio-specific project files and configurations.

## üöÄ Setup and Configuration

### Visual Studio

This project is designed to be run and developed using Visual Studio. Make sure you have Visual Studio installed to work with the project. 

### SFML Configuration

To handle audio files and other media, the project uses SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). You will need to configure SFML in Visual Studio to ensure that the audio components work correctly. Please follow the SFML setup guide for Visual Studio available on the [SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
If you want to avoid the hassle of SFML altogether, considering removing the **`#include <sound.h>`** directive from the **`game.h`** header.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Notes

- **Best Practices**:\
      This project does not adhere to best practices or coding standards, as it was developed by first-year students with limited experience. Please consider this when reviewing the code.

- **File Size Warnings**:\
      Some files might exceed GitHub's recommended size limits. These files are related to Visual Studio project configurations and are not essential to the core functionality of the project.

- **Understanding the code**:\
      Before you dive into the project code, I suggest you view the code files in **`main code`** folder where the documentation for all the functions is present. Otherwise, you might get overwhelmed.

## üíª How to Run

1. Open the project: "Rambo Final.vcxproj" in Visual Studio.
2. Ensure that SFML is properly configured.
3. Build the solution.
4. Run the project from within Visual Studio.
